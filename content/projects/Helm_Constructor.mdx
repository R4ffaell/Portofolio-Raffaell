**Helmet Detection System** is an AI-powered object detection model built with **YOLOv8** to enhance construction site safety by identifying whether workers are wearing protective helmets.

- 🎯 **Trained to detect construction helmets**.
- ⚡ **Real-time inference-ready** using YOLOv8.
- 🧠 Based on the open **_Hard Hat Workers_** dataset from Roboflow.
- 🔁 **Reproducible pipeline** using Roboflow + Ultralytics + Google Colab.

### 🏗️ Why This Matters

This project acts as an AI-powered safety compliance checker for construction environments. Manual safety enforcement is expensive and reactive—this system is proactive and automated.

**Key benefits:**

- ✅ **Runs efficiently** on CPUs or edge devices.
- 🎥 **Easy to integrate** into site surveillance cameras.
- 🔓 **Open-source** and customizable for other PPE types.

---

### 🚀 Use Case

Imagine a smart CCTV at a construction site. It scans incoming workers, detects if they’re wearing helmets, and logs or alerts if not. No manual checking needed.

### 🔍 Detected Class

- 🪖 head — labeled as helmet in the dataset.
- 🪖 helmet — labeled as helmet in the dataset.
- 🧍 body — labeled as the body (worker).

### 🏋️ Training the Model

```python
from ultralytics import YOLO

model = YOLO("yolov8n.pt")
model.train(data="Hard-Hat-Workers-14/data.yaml", epochs=50, imgsz=640)
```

---

### 📊 Evaluation on Test Data

```python
metrics = model.val(data="Hard-Hat-Workers-14/data.yaml", split='test')
```

---

### 🖼️ Predicting on a Folder of Images

```python
results = model.predict(source="Hard-Hat-Workers-14/test/images", save=True, conf=0.25)
```

---

This project lays the foundation for more comprehensive safety tools — expand it with classes for vests, goggles, or even unsafe behaviors. With YOLOv8 and the right data, construction safety is smarter than ever.
