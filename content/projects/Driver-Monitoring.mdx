title: Driver Behavior Detection System
description: The Driver Behavior Detection System is a real-time computer vision application that identifies unsafe driver behaviors such as yawning, distraction, and drowsiness. Built using OpenCV, Mediapipe, and PyTorch, the system is optimized for edge deployment using Raspberry Pi 5. It includes hardware integration with a Pi Camera, LED indicators, buzzer alerts, and a GSM module (SIM808) for emergency communication. The model is also deployed as a web-based application, making it accessible and scalable.

This project aims to improve road safety by detecting dangerous driver behaviors in real time. The system leverages deep learning for behavior classification and is integrated with physical components for alert mechanisms and remote notifications. It supports both local (Raspberry Pi) and cloud/web deployment for broader accessibility.
