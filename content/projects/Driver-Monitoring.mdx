## 🚗 Driver Behavior Detection System

The **Driver Behavior Detection System** is a real-time computer vision solution designed to monitor driver attentiveness and ensure road safety. It leverages state-of-the-art deep learning techniques for behavior recognition and integrates seamlessly with hardware components for real-world deployment.

### 💡 Key Features

- **Real-Time Behavior Classification**  
  Detects yawning, distraction, drowsiness, and more using facial landmarks and temporal motion tracking.

- **Multi-Platform Deployment**

  - 💻 **Web App**: Accessible via browser for demonstration or cloud deployment.
  - 🍓 **Edge Device (Raspberry Pi 5)**: Optimized for low-latency, real-time inference using Pi Camera.

- **Hardware Integration**

  - 📷 Pi Camera: Captures live video feed.
  - 🚨 LED + Buzzer: Instant visual and auditory alerts when unsafe behavior is detected.
  - 📡 SIM808 GSM Module: Sends automated SMS alerts to emergency contacts in critical situations.

- **Technologies Used**
  - `OpenCV`, `MediaPipe`, and `PyTorch` for vision and modeling.
  - `Flask` (for web interface), `RPi.GPIO` (for hardware control), and `pySerial` (for GSM communication).

### 🧠 Model Training & Architecture

- Behavior classification model trained using transfer learning on a custom annotated dataset.
- Model evaluated on metrics like accuracy, F1-score, and latency for edge-readiness.
- Post-processed with ONNX for efficient deployment on Raspberry Pi.

### 🌍 Use Cases

- Driver monitoring systems for logistics/fleet vehicles.
- Embedded safety solutions for smart vehicles.
- Real-time road safety demo in academic or research settings.
