# Overview

**Hand Sign Detector** is a real-time application that uses a trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to recognize and classify hand signs captured through a webcam.

Itâ€™s designed for fast and accurate classification of static hand gestures, making it ideal for educational projects, assistive tech prototypes, or interactive demos.

The system processes the live camera feed, isolates the region of interest, preprocesses it into grayscale images, and feeds it into the CNN model to predict the corresponding hand sign label.

It also supports evaluation using test images and includes performance metrics such as a confusion matrix and F1-score for detailed analysis.

# ðŸ”§ Features
